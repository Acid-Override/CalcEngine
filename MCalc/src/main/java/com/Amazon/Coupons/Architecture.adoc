Designing a coupon system for an e-commerce site requires handling coupon generation, validation, and application logic based on products and their categories. Below is a high-level architecture and design for such a system.

'''

== *System Design Overview*

The coupon system should allow:
1. *Coupon Generation* – Creating coupons with rules based on products, categories, discounts, and validity periods.
2. *Coupon Storage &amp; Retrieval* – Storing generated coupons and efficiently fetching them for validation.
3. *Coupon Validation* – Ensuring coupons are valid based on rules like expiration date, product/category match, usage limits, etc.
4. *Coupon Application* – Applying valid coupons to eligible products during checkout.
5. *Coupon Expiry &amp; Tracking* – Tracking usage limits, invalidating expired coupons, and auditing coupon applications.

'''

== *Architecture Components*

=== *1. Database Schema (Using MongoDB or SQL)*

Tables/Collections required:

==== *Coupons Table*

|===
|Field |Type |Description 

|`coupon_id` |String (UUID) |Unique coupon identifier 
|`code` |String |Unique coupon code 
|`discount_type` |Enum (PERCENTAGE, FIXED) |Type of discount 
|`discount_value` |Decimal |Percentage or fixed amount 
|`applicable_to` |Enum (PRODUCT, CATEGORY) |Defines if it applies to a product or category 
|`product_ids` |Array[String] |List of applicable product IDs (if applicable) 
|`category_ids` |Array[String] |List of applicable category IDs (if applicable) 
|`valid_from` |Timestamp |Coupon start date 
|`valid_until` |Timestamp |Coupon expiry date 
|`usage_limit` |Integer |Maximum number of uses allowed 
|`times_used` |Integer |Number of times the coupon has been used 
|===

==== *User_Coupons Table*

|===
|Field |Type |Description 

|`user_id` |String |User who applied the coupon 
|`coupon_id` |String |The applied coupon ID 
|`applied_at` |Timestamp |Date and time of application 
|===

'''

=== *2. Coupon Generation Service*

* *Inputs:* Discount details, applicable products/categories, validity period, usage limits.
* *Outputs:* Generates a unique coupon code and stores it in the database.

*Example Flow:*
1. Admin requests coupon creation (`10% off all Electronics`).
2. System generates a unique coupon code (e.g., `ELEC10OFF`).
3. The coupon is stored with category association (`category_id = Electronics`).
4. Users can retrieve and apply this coupon at checkout.

'''

=== *3. Coupon Validation Service*

* *Checks the following before applying a coupon:*
. *Validity period* – `valid_from <= current_time <= valid_until`
. *Usage limit* – `times_used < usage_limit`
. *Product/category match* – Ensures coupon applies to selected items
. *User eligibility* – Checks if the user has already used the coupon (if applicable)
* *Returns:* Coupon status (valid/invalid) and applicable discount.

*Validation API Example:*

[source,json]
----
{
  "coupon_code": "ELEC10OFF",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "cart_items": [
    { "product_id": "p1", "category_id": "electronics", "price": 100 }
  ]
}
----

*Response:*

[source,json]
----
{
  "valid": true,
  "discount_applied": 10,
  "message": "10% off applied to Electronics."
}
----

'''

=== *4. Coupon Application Service*

* Applies validated discounts to cart totals.
* Ensures correct deduction in checkout.

*Discount Calculation Example (Pseudocode):*

[source,python]
----
def apply_coupon(cart, coupon):
    discount = 0
    for item in cart["items"]:
        if coupon.applies_to(item):
            if coupon.discount_type == "PERCENTAGE":
                discount += (item.price * coupon.discount_value / 100)
            elif coupon.discount_type == "FIXED":
                discount += coupon.discount_value
    return discount
----

'''

=== *5. Expiry &amp; Tracking Service*

* *Runs a periodic job to:*
. Expire old coupons (`valid_until < NOW()`).
. Update `times_used` counter when a coupon is applied.
. Notify users of upcoming expirations.
'''

== *Tech Stack Recommendations*

* *Backend:* Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js (Express)
* *Database:* PostgreSQL/MySQL (relational) or MongoDB (NoSQL)
* *Caching:* Redis (for fast coupon lookups)
* *Queue Processing:* Kafka or RabbitMQ (for processing coupon expirations and tracking usage)
'''

== *API Endpoints Design*

=== *1. Generate Coupon*

`POST /coupons`

[source,json]
----
{
  "code": "ELEC10OFF",
  "discount_type": "PERCENTAGE",
  "discount_value": 10,
  "applicable_to": "CATEGORY",
  "category_ids": ["electronics"],
  "valid_from": "2025-03-20T00:00:00Z",
  "valid_until": "2025-04-20T23:59:59Z",
  "usage_limit": 100
}
----

=== *2. Validate Coupon*

`POST /coupons/validate`

[source,json]
----
{
  "coupon_code": "ELEC10OFF",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "cart_items": [
    { "product_id": "p1", "category_id": "electronics", "price": 100 }
  ]
}
----

=== *3. Apply Coupon*

`POST /coupons/apply`

[source,json]
----
{
  "coupon_code": "ELEC10OFF",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "cart_id": "CART123"
}
----

'''

== *Scalability Considerations*

. *Redis Cache* – Frequently used coupons can be cached to reduce DB queries.
. *Rate Limiting* – Prevent abuse by limiting coupon validation requests.
. *Sharding in Database* – Split coupons and users across multiple DB instances if needed.
. *Event-Driven Processing* – Use Kafka to process coupon usage asynchronously.
'''

== *Conclusion*

This system enables efficient coupon generation, validation, and application while ensuring flexibility for products and categories. It is designed for performance, scalability, and ease of use in an e-commerce environment.
